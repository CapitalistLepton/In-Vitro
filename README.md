# Abstract

In-Vitro is a web game where a randomly generated population of bacteria evolve
and must be eradicated by the player. The player can select to use different
antibiotics with a wide range of effects to slow down and weed out certain
genotypes present in the bacteria population. Furthermore, the player has many
different stains at their disposal to visually see certain genotypes of the
bacteria. The goal is to wipe out all of the bacteria using the given budget.
If the player runs out of money or the bacteria population gets too large, the
player loses.
